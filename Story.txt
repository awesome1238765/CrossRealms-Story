Prologue 
	Well I guess that the end of the world wasn’t all that bad. The world didn’t burst into flames or explode into millions of pieces. All that happened was that we got warped into the past, present and future. Did I forget to mention that the warp unleashed dangerous creatures such as the Griffin from Greek mythology and dinos such as the Tyrannosaurus-rex? Did I also forget to mention that the creatures that I just mentioned had even more dangerous variations? Well, welcome to my world. The world I like to call CrossRealms.
	
































Chapter 1
I woke up like any other day and stared out the window. The window wasn’t there. At that moment I realized the whole house wasn’t there. It was just a bed in the middle of the desert. I just thought to myself, “Why am I here in the middle of the desert?”. Turns out it was a dream again.
Did I forget to introduce myself? My name is Alex.
